# Safe-Multi-Objective-MuJoCo

The repository is for Safe Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) research, leveraging MuJoCo, several Safe Multi-Objective environments have been developed to evaluate the performance of safe MORL algorithms: Safe Multi-Objective HalfCheetah, Safe Multi-Objective Hopper, Safe Multi-Objective Humanoid, Safe Multi-Objective Swimmer, Safe Multi-Objective Walker, and Safe Multi-Objective Pusherhave been introduced to evaluate the effectiveness of safe MORL methods. (This repository is under actively development. We appreciate any constructive comments and suggestions)
